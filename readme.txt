Andestech AE350 Platform

The AE350 prototype demonstrates the AE350 example platform on the FPGA. 
This configuration builds with Linux 5.4 and OpenSBI 0.7 tarballs from 
AndeSight 5.0.0 package.

How to build it
===============

Configure Buildroot
-------------------

Note that this repo is not self-contained, please check Buildroot Documentation [1].

  $ make BR2_EXTERNAL=/path/to/this/repo andes_ae350_defconfig

If you want to customize your configuration:

  $ make menuconfig

Mentioned tarballs should be configured to the file location, for example

  $ cat .config
  ...
  BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_CUSTOM_TARBALL_LOCATION="file:///tmp/linux-5.4.tgz"
  BR2_TARGET_OPENSBI_CUSTOM_TARBALL_LOCATION="file:///tmp/opensbi.tgz"
  ...

Build everything
----------------
Note: you will need to access to the network, since Buildroot will
download the packages' sources.

  $ make

Result of the build
-------------------

After building, you should obtain the following files:

  output/images/
  +-- Image
  +-- ae350.dtb
  +-- boot.scr
  +-- boot.vfat
  +-- fw_dynamic.bin
  +-- fw_dynamic.elf
  +-- fw_jump.bin
  +-- fw_jump.elf
  +-- rootfs.cpio
  +-- rootfs.ext2
  +-- rootfs.ext4 -> rootfs.ext2
  +-- rootfs.tar
  +-- sdcard.img
  +-- u-boot-spl.bin
  +-- u-boot.itb

Copy the sdcard.img to a SD card with "dd":

  $ sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4096

As a reference, the SD card partition will be like:

  Disk /dev/mmcblk0: 31457280 sectors, 3072M
  Logical sector size: 512
  Disk identifier (GUID): 546663ee-d2f1-427f-93a5-5c7b69dd801c
  Partition table holds up to 128 entries
  First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 385062

  Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size Name
       1              34          262177  128M u-boot
       2          262178          385057 60.0M rootfs

Run
---

Use the SPI_Burn tool [2] to burn the u-boot-spl.bin file onto the flash.  Reference command:

  $ ./SPI_Burn --image u-boot-spl.bin --verify --unlock

Make sure the SD card is inserted and then reset the board, it should boot Linux from mmc.
